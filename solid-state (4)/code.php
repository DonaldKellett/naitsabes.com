											<p>This is a simple template I quickly whipped up within a few hours.  The real reason I created this template from scratch (well, almost) is because I am planning to release a <b>huge</b> project in the future but more on that later ;)  Anyway if you look at the name of this template you can almost guess what it will be about.</p>

											<h3 class="major">Naitsabes Forums Version I Source Code</h3>
											<p>After almost two whole years of experience in coding (or, more accurately, web development), I have finally managed to code my own real, working, legitimate Forums from scratch using my newfound knowledge on PHP, SQL and executing SQL statements using PHP.  This code was originally intended for my own use but since it'll be at least a few weeks before I actually host the Forums on my site, I thought, why not release the source code?</p>
											<p>
												The source code for my personal Forums is MIT Licensed, so yeah, do whatever you want with it (as long as you don't hold me responsible for anything) :p
