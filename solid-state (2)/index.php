										<h2 class="major">About Me</h2>
										<p>
											I am Donald Sebastian Leung, a Year 12 (Sixth Form) student studying at Kellett School. My favorite subject is Maths, and my favorite pastime is coding.  This year, I am starting my AS courses for Further Maths, Physics, Chemistry and Economics. I am also planning to take A2 Maths this year.  In the near future, I would like to study (in descending order) Mathematics, Computer Science, Chemistry or Physics in a well-known university, preferably somewhere in Asia.

											<li>The <strong>Naitsabes Discussion Corner</strong> is finally out.  To go there, simply click on the &quot;Menu&quot; bar and select the option &quot;Discussion Corner&quot;.  In the <strong>Naitsabes Discussion Corner</strong>, you are allowed to create topics and discussions on basically any subject as long as it is appropriate.  Feel free to start your first discussion there and enjoy!</li>
											<li>The AS Mock Exams are finally complete.  I think I have done well on all of the papers except one, but that will have to wait until I get my results back next Monday.  Now the only exam left for me is C34 Maths, which is next Monday.  Hopefully I will do just fine on it.</li>
											<li>I have recently added a search function in the Naitsabes Discussion Corner.  However, since my coding skills are currently not good enough, I have not yet been able to figure out how to create a search engine within my own website.  Therefore all the search function does is pass on the query to Google with an instruction of searching within my site only.  Hopefully in the near future I will finally learn how to create a search engine of my own.  Anyway the search function does the job so feel free to use it and enjoy!</li>
